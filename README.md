# magic8 :8ball::8ball::8ball:
Hello all! Welcome magic8, a physics final project for Ms. Sharaf’s AP Physics C class of the :two::zero::one::eight: :arrow_right: :two::zero::one::nine: school year, created by Thomas Lee :pray: and Jeffrey Wu :muscle:.

# The Game :space_invader::video_game:
The game is quite similar to pool in that you are using a cue to hit a cue ball (the white one) into other balls. The aim of the game is to pocket all the colored balls into any of the six pockets situated around the table. The factor that makes our game unique, in addition to introducing a physics aspect to our game, is that different balls have different masses. This is to demonstrate conservation of linear momentum. Included at the bottom of your screen will be a table that reflects certain attributes of objects within the game. Such values include the balls’ masses, x velocities, y velocities, x momentums, y momentums, and momentum vectors.

Use this game as an opportunity to learn physics and as with any game, remember to have fun :bangbang::bangbang:
